```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```


## Figures

The figure sizes have been customised so that you can easily put two images side-by-side. 

```{r, fig.cap = "This is the first figure."}
plot(1:10)
```

```{r, fig.cap = "This is the second figure."}
plot(10:1)
```

This is the first footnote^[Very simple footnote.]. This is the second footnote^[Wow, this is really easy.]
